  <h1>My Favorite Terraria Content Mods</h1>
  <p>This list is merely my opinion.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
	  <img src="calamity.png" alt="Calamity Mod">
	  <p>Currently the most downloaded mod in the tModLoader workshop in Steam, and for good reason as well.</p>
	  <p>The mod adds more hours into a game, which already takes a ton of hours to beat, and includes content and game progression even after beating the base game's final boss.</p>
	  <p>Calamity adds tons of new bosses, biomes, weapons, armor sets, blocks, music, and even harder difficulty options.</p>
